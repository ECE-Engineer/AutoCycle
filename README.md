# AutoCycleNet :recycle: (Expect A Big Update By 2/25/19) :recycle:
Real-time detection of recyclable vs trash items and automatic material sorting of recyclable items.
Recyclable items are sorted into the following categories:
* Cardboard
* Glass
* Metal
* Paper
* Plastic

## ToDo List (not completely in order yet)
- [ ] Refactor the code to a more developer friendly format
- [ ] Upload our own training dataset that filters certain items from the TrashNet data corpus and appends to it our own photographed data
- [ ] Provide Runnable documentation for a mobile user
- [ ] Provide Runnable documentation for a developer
- [ ] Provide Runnable documentation for integration into an industrial setting
- [ ] Upload the TensorFlow designed ML model
- [ ] Upload a statitics chart comparing the performance of the ML 2 models
- [ ] Upload a much needed blog on how to install all the requirements for training an ML model on GCP's GPU intances
- [ ] Making sure the mobile development and hosting repositories are up

## Future Endeavor
- [ ] Create a physical prototype to integrate this idea

### Credits
Thank you to @garythung for developing the base code for resizing & for creating the base dataset used to make this endeavor possible.
